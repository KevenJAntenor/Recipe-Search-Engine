# Recipe Search Engine

## Description

This project is a C program that enables recipe searching within a database. The database is loaded from a file (passed as an argument) into a linked list. The search can be performed by category and optionally with a keyword. This project was assigned as part of the INF3135 course lab work in Fall 2022.
